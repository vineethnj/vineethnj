I've always been the kind of person deeply excited about the idea of purpose—why we exist, what we're meant to do. That search led me to explore the world of technology, where somewhere along the way, I found a spark in building applications.

I started with code—learning logic, writing functions, solving problems—but something felt off. I realized: this isn't the full picture. It wasn't just about the syntax. I was searching for something more intelligent. More meaningful. And then, I stepped into Artificial Intelligence.

My journey began with data—understanding it, cleaning it, respecting its power. Then came Machine Learning and Deep Learning, where I tried overwhelmingly hard, sometimes lost, sometimes stuck, but always driven. I knew I needed to turn this into something real. So, I built a few intermediate-level AI apps. Not perfect. But mine. And they taught me more than any course could.

The deep end
During my BCA, I got a chance to work as an AI Researcher at a startup—my first big break. It was freelance, it was scrappy, and I was still a student, navigating the rough realities of the Indian education system. But I learned to swim in the deep end early.

More freelance gigs came my way, but honestly—I was scared. Imposter syndrome is real. But still, I showed up. And when I dove deeper into the world of AI, especially LLMs, it felt like exploring galaxies. It was vast. Unknown. Powerful. That's when the real fun began—building actual AI products, not just following tutorials.

Building something real
Later, I joined as an AI Engineer and that's where my journey evolved. I wasn't just learning anymore—I was building. Today, I'm not just someone learning AI. I'm someone living it.

Now, as the founder of Orbitrar, I'm taking everything I've learned and channeling it into building something that matters. We're creating AI solutions that don't just follow trends but actually solve real problems. It's scary and exhilarating at the same time—going from employee to entrepreneur, from building for others to building my own vision.

The future is collaborative
I believe that we'll more effectively advance our understanding of AI by collaborating with the wider community of researchers and builders. Through Orbitrar, the plan is to continue building, learning, and sharing knowledge with fellow builders who share this vision, ultimately helping advance the field through both innovation and thoughtful development.

Still excited. Still scared sometimes. But always moving forward—project by project, model by model, purpose by purpose. Because at the end of the day, this isn't just about the technology. It's about using that technology to create something meaningful.
